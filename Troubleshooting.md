# General template issues

## Generic possible issues
There are certain issues that can arise that are common to many of the app templates. Please check [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-stickers-app/wiki/Troubleshooting) for reference to these.

# Problems deploying to Azure

## 1. Error when attempting to reuse a Microsoft Azure AD application ID for the bot registration
```
Bot is not valid. Errors: MsaAppId is already in use.
```

* Creating the resource of type Microsoft.BotService/botServices failed with status "BadRequest"

This happens when the Microsoft Azure application ID entered during the setup of the deployment has already been used and registered for a bot.

#### Fix
Either register a new Microsoft Azure AD application or delete the bot registration that is currently using the attempted Microsoft Azure application ID.
